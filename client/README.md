# Fv Client

Created with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [front-end framework](http://materializecss.com/) based on Material Design.

***

## Quick Start

To compile assets you need download dependences first, by typing two commands in one line:
> npm install && bower install

assuming you have installed proper tools (node, bower, grunt).

Then Grunt's tasks do rest:
> grunt build
and
> grunt compile

## Usage

User can create and edit invoice and clients. Each invoice can be downloaded as PDF or send to client directly. User is allowed to remove an invoice, too.
